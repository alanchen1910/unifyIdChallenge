Follow Up Questions:

Circumstances that would lead to a false positive are:
- if a user goes to a location with an ip address that was previously marked as fraud and tries to log in
- a normal user lives near someone who has made a fraudulent login attempt

Circustances that would leave to false negatives:
- a fraudulent user tries to make a fraudulent login attempt on vacation/business trip that is far away from any flagged ip addresses
- a fraudulent user uses a contact far away from flagged ip addresses to make fraudulent login attempts
